Intelligent spam protection for WordPress forms, comments, and reviews. No CAPTCHA needed. Works with WPForms, Contact Form 7, WooCommerce, and more.

== Description ==

= Anti-Spam Protection Without CAPTCHAs =

ActiveLayer is an intelligent anti-spam solution that stops **contact form spam**, **comment spam**, and registration spam without CAPTCHAs, puzzles, or extra steps for your visitors. Your forms stay fast and frictionless while unwanted messages get caught automatically.

Your time and attention are expensive — stop spending them on spam. ActiveLayer protects popular form builders like **WPForms**, **Contact Form 7**, **Gravity Forms**, **Elementor Forms**, **Fluent Forms**, **WS Form**, and **FunnelKit Funnel Builder**, plus **native WordPress comments**, **WooCommerce** (product reviews and customer registration), **Easy Digital Downloads** (store reviews and customer registration), **AffiliateWP**, **MemberPress**, and **BuddyPress / BuddyBoss signup forms**, all from a single plugin. With 18 integrations, you manage all your spam protection from one settings page.

= Zero Friction Spam Filtering =

Most anti-spam tools either show visitors a CAPTCHA or make every form wait while the check runs. ActiveLayer takes a different approach. Async integrations complete immediately while background checks run through Action Scheduler; registration and inline-blocking integrations can run a synchronous check when spam must be stopped before an account, entry, or affiliate record is created.

This keeps normal form workflows fast while still allowing high-risk signup flows to block spam inline. If a submission is clean, notifications are sent as normal. If it is flagged, notifications are suppressed or the signup is blocked depending on the integration.

= Intelligent Spam Detection =

ActiveLayer analyzes submission patterns, content reputation, behavioral signals, and environment data to catch both automated bots and human bad actors with high accuracy. Unlike simple honeypot or keyword-blocklist approaches, ActiveLayer uses multiple signals to make smarter decisions about every submission.

Optional behavioral tracking monitors how users interact with your forms — keystrokes, mouse movements, touch events, and scroll patterns. Environment detection identifies headless browsers and automated tools. These client-side signals are sent alongside form data for deeper analysis.

= Per-Form Control and Sync Mode =

You decide exactly which forms to protect. ActiveLayer protects all supported forms and WooCommerce surfaces by default after your API key is connected — you can disable protection per form if needed. This gives you granular control over every contact form, registration form, or comment section on your site.

Sync Mode lets supported integrations wait for the API verdict before the submission completes, so spam can be blocked inline. By default, ActiveLayer runs checks asynchronously for maximum speed. Turn Sync Mode on when you prefer inline blocking and can tolerate a small added latency on submissions.

= Fail-Safe by Design =

If the ActiveLayer API is temporarily unavailable, your forms keep working. ActiveLayer is designed to **fail open** — it restores provider defaults, preserves every submission, and retries background checks automatically when connectivity returns. No lost submissions, no blocked emails, no broken forms.

Automatic retries handle transient failures. A built-in watchdog checks queue health every 15 minutes and shows admin notices when pending items build up or Action Scheduler is unavailable. You always know the status of your protection.

= Full Visibility Dashboard =

See exactly what is happening with your form protection at a glance. The ActiveLayer dashboard shows submission totals, spam caught, accuracy rates, queue health, and integration status — all in one place. Filter submissions by status or provider, and use bulk actions to recheck, mark as clean or junk, or trash items you no longer need.

Every submission is logged in a custom database table. You can review verdicts, recheck past submissions with a fresh API call, and override any decision. Debug logging (opt-in, PII-redacted) gives you even deeper insight when troubleshooting.

= Who Is ActiveLayer For? =

### Small Business Websites
Protect your contact forms and inquiry forms without adding friction for potential customers. Async form submissions from real visitors go through instantly while junk gets caught behind the scenes.

### Bloggers and Publishers
Stop comment spam on your posts without requiring readers to solve CAPTCHAs or prove they are human. ActiveLayer checks comments in the background and can auto-approve clean ones or auto-mark detected spam.

### Agencies Managing Multiple Sites
One plugin covers WPForms, Contact Form 7, Gravity Forms, Elementor Forms, Fluent Forms, Formidable Forms, WooCommerce, and more — every integration managed from one settings page. No need to configure separate anti-spam tools for each form builder or WooCommerce surface your clients use.

### E-commerce and Service Businesses
Keep inquiry and support forms clean while maintaining a fast, professional user experience. Async checks keep contact forms moving quickly, while registration gates can block spam accounts inline. **WooCommerce stores** get dedicated protection for product reviews and My Account customer registration — and the checkout itself is never gated, so spam protection can't get in the way of a sale.

### Membership Sites and Online Communities
Running a community on **BuddyPress** or **BuddyBoss Platform**? ActiveLayer hooks the public signup form and blocks spam registrations before they create fake accounts — no extra CAPTCHA in front of your real members, no manual moderation queue to babysit. The integration covers both free BuddyPress and BuddyBoss Platform with a dedicated admin toggle for each.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does ActiveLayer add a CAPTCHA to my forms? =

No. ActiveLayer is a completely CAPTCHA-free anti-spam solution. Spam checks happen server-side in the background, so your visitors never see puzzles, challenges, or extra steps. Forms stay fast and frictionless.

= Which form builders does ActiveLayer support? =

ActiveLayer works with WPForms (Lite and Pro), Contact Form 7, Gravity Forms, Elementor Forms (Pro), Fluent Forms, Formidable Forms, Forminator, Ninja Forms, SureForms, WS Form, FunnelKit Funnel Builder (opt-in forms), native WordPress comments, WooCommerce, Easy Digital Downloads, BuddyPress / BuddyBoss Platform signup forms, AffiliateWP affiliate registration, and MemberPress membership registration — 18 integrations in total. All are managed from a single settings page with per-form control.

= Do visitors have to wait for the spam check? =

Usually no. Async integrations are queued and checked in the background via Action Scheduler, so the form or comment completes immediately. Integrations that must block account or entry creation, such as registration flows and some sync form providers, wait briefly for the API verdict and fail open if the API is unavailable.

= What is Sync Mode and when should I use it? =

Sync Mode makes supported integrations wait for the API verdict before the submission completes, allowing the plugin to block spam inline. By default, ActiveLayer uses async processing where possible for maximum speed. Some registration integrations are synchronous by design because spam must be blocked before an account, membership, or affiliate record is created.

= What happens if the ActiveLayer API is temporarily unavailable? =

ActiveLayer is designed to fail open. If the API cannot be reached, your forms keep working normally — notifications still send, comments are preserved with their original status, and background checks automatically retry when connectivity returns. No submissions are ever lost.

= Is ActiveLayer free to use? =

Yes. ActiveLayer offers a free tier. Create your account at [activelayer.com](https://activelayer.com/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteplugin) to get your API key and start protecting your forms and comments from spam.

= Can I protect only specific forms instead of all forms? =

Absolutely. ActiveLayer protects all supported forms by default once your API key is connected. You can disable protection on individual forms through the form builder settings if preferred. Forms without an explicit disable setting remain protected.

= How does ActiveLayer compare to other anti-spam solutions? =

ActiveLayer uses async queue processing where possible, plus synchronous gates where inline blocking is required. It also supports per-form toggles, optional Sync Mode for supported providers, and integrates with eleven popular form builders, WordPress comments, WooCommerce, BuddyPress / BuddyBoss signup forms, AffiliateWP affiliate registrations, and MemberPress membership registrations from a single plugin. Unlike blocklist-based tools, ActiveLayer analyzes multiple signals for more accurate spam detection.

= Can I recheck past submissions with a fresh verdict? =

Yes. In ActiveLayer → Submissions, use row actions or bulk actions to "Recheck with API". Submissions are re-queued and updated when new verdicts return. This is useful after tuning your settings or when you want to re-evaluate older items.

= Can I use ActiveLayer alongside other anti-spam tools? =

In most cases, yes. ActiveLayer integrates cleanly with supported form builders and WordPress comments. If you run multiple anti-spam solutions, start with protection enabled on a single test form to verify there are no conflicts or double-filtering issues before rolling it out to the rest of your site.

= Does ActiveLayer work with BuddyPress and BuddyBoss? =

Yes. ActiveLayer protects the public BuddyPress / BuddyBoss signup form (`/register/`) with a synchronous spam check that runs after BuddyPress's own validation but before the pending signup record is created. Spam is blocked inline with a message rendered next to the username field (or next to the email field on BuddyBoss Platform, which doesn't render a separate username input). Each platform has its own admin toggle in **ActiveLayer → Integrations** so you only enable the one that matches your install.

Coverage is intentionally scoped to public signups. Activity stream posts, private messages, group updates, bbPress, and the BuddyBoss App REST signup endpoint are out of scope for this release.

= Does ActiveLayer protect the WooCommerce checkout? =

ActiveLayer protects WooCommerce product reviews and the standalone My Account registration form (`[woocommerce_my_account]`). It intentionally does **not** gate registration during checkout — neither the classic `[woocommerce_checkout]` shortcode nor the block-based Cart/Checkout. A spam check there could abort the whole order, so a false positive would cost a sale; ActiveLayer keeps the path to purchase clear and leaves the checkout itself ungated.

== External services ==

This plugin connects to the ActiveLayer API to analyze form submissions and comments for spam. It is the core service that powers all spam detection — without it, the plugin cannot classify submissions.

= ActiveLayer API =

**What it does:** Provides spam detection verdicts (clean or spam) for form submissions and comments.

**When data is sent:** Each time a protected form submission, comment, review, or registration is checked, the submission data is sent to the API for analysis. Depending on the integration, this can happen through the background queue or during a synchronous inline-blocking check.

**What data is sent:**
* Submission content (name, email, message, URL if provided)
* IP address and user agent of the submitter
* Form metadata (form ID, form name, provider name)
* Site URL and WordPress locale
* Behavioral and environment signals (if enabled in settings)

**Service provider:** ActiveLayer ([activelayer.com](https://activelayer.com/))
* [Terms of Service](https://activelayer.com/terms)
* [Privacy Policy](https://activelayer.com/privacy)

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 1.7.1 =
Fixes site connection for API keys saved with "Save Changes" instead of "Verify Key": the site was never registered with ActiveLayer, so the dashboard did not list it and referral bonuses tied to connecting a site never arrived. Recommended for everyone who entered the key manually.

= 1.7.0 =
Two-way spam status sync with WPForms Pro entries, a proper pre-save block that honours "Store Spam Entries" in sync mode, and a Submissions page with IP column, per-page setting, Delete bulk action and a Delete All tool. Also fixes WPForms notification emails being lost in asynchronous mode when Action Scheduler is unavailable. Tested up to WordPress 7.1. Recommended upgrade.

= 1.6.2 =
Fixes a WPForms conflict where notification emails for forms with Repeater fields showed only the first row. Recommended for anyone using Repeater fields.
Fixes submission dates being shown with the wrong time on any site not set to UTC. Recommended for all sites outside UTC.

= 1.6.1 =
Fixes a multisite bug where subsites never created their submissions table, leaving the dashboard stuck loading and form submissions unchecked. Each site now provisions its table automatically. Recommended for all multisite networks.

= 1.6.0 =
Adds read-only WordPress Abilities (WordPress 6.9+) so compatible tools and AI assistants can query your anti-spam data, plus a WPForms fix that releases held email notifications when the queue runs via admin-ajax. Recommended upgrade.

= 1.5.0 =
Adds Easy Digital Downloads and FunnelKit Funnel Builder spam protection, plus improved client-side signal-integrity diagnostics for more accurate detection. Recommended upgrade.

= 1.4.1 =
Smoother checkout and signup for WooCommerce and MemberPress — purchases and paid memberships now complete without interruption. Standalone registration forms stay protected. Recommended for sites using either integration.

= 1.4.0 =
Adds AffiliateWP, MemberPress, and WS Form spam protection, payment-form detection signals for WPForms, and five new translations. Includes fixes for message-body handling, WPForms "Not Spam" re-processing, and Pro-plugin detection on the dashboard. Recommended upgrade.

= 1.3.1 =
Fixes stale admin and frontend assets after the 1.3.0 update — the internal version used for cache-busting was not bumped, so browsers kept loading cached 1.2.0 CSS/JS. Recommended for everyone on 1.3.0.

= 1.3.0 =
Adds BuddyPress / BuddyBoss signup protection and one-click Connect. Form protection is enabled by default for all supported providers after your API key is connected. Existing forms you've explicitly disabled remain disabled.

= 1.2.0 =
WooCommerce integration: spam protection for Product Reviews and Customer Registration. Adds silent-discard for high-confidence spam and native moderation feedback. Fixes moderator email timing for held comments. Tested up to WordPress 7.0. Recommended upgrade.

= 1.1.0 =
Five new form integrations (Gravity Forms, Elementor Forms, Fluent Forms, Forminator, SureForms), global Sync Mode, client-side behavioral and environment signals, Tools page with bulk delete, conditional frontend script loading, and security hardening. Recommended upgrade for all users.

== Changelog ==

= 1.7.1 =
* Fixed: Settings — saving a new API key with "Save Changes" now verifies it and registers the site with ActiveLayer, exactly like the "Verify Key" button. Previously only "Verify Key" and the one-click Connect flow did this, and "Verify Key" disappears once a key is stored, so sites set up by pasting the key and saving were never registered: they did not appear as connected in the ActiveLayer dashboard and referral bonuses that depend on connecting a site were never granted. Existing keys are not re-verified until you save a different one.

= 1.7.0 =
* Added: WPForms — spam status now syncs both ways, including forms using tracking mode. Marking a submission as Spam or Clean in ActiveLayer updates the matching WPForms Pro entry, and using WPForms' own "Spam" / "Not Spam" entry actions (single or bulk) corrects the ActiveLayer submission and sends feedback to the API. Status sync preserves trashed submissions and trashed or incomplete WPForms entries.
* Added: Submissions — new "IP Address" column so you can spot recurring IPs and subnets at a glance.
* Added: Submissions — choose how many submissions to show per page (1–200) from the Screen Options panel. Defaults to 20 as before.
* Added: Submissions — "Delete" bulk action that removes selected submissions permanently, alongside the existing "Move to Trash".
* Added: Submissions — "Mark as Spam" and "Mark as Clean" bulk actions are now both offered on the All view, so you no longer have to switch to the Clean or Spam tab to change a status.
* Added: Tools — "Delete All Submissions" tool that wipes every stored submission regardless of status or age, including Trash, and immediately refreshes submission lists, counts and cached details.
* Fixed: WPForms — in synchronous mode, forms with "Store Spam Entries" turned off no longer save a spam entry. Spam is now rejected before the entry is written, so no notification, webhook, marketing or user-registration action fires for blocked submissions. Forms that store spam entries and payment forms keep the previous post-save behaviour. Retrying a failed check does not resend notifications already handled by WPForms.
* Fixed: WPForms — the custom block message is now shown to the visitor. Previously WPForms discarded it and displayed only its generic error notice.
* Fixed: WPForms — entries marked as spam now name ActiveLayer in the "This entry was marked as spam by …" notice on the entry details screen.
* Fixed: WPForms — in asynchronous mode, notification emails are no longer lost on sites where Action Scheduler is unavailable. Previously the notification was held waiting for a verdict that could never arrive, so the email was never sent.
* Fixed: Submissions — the bottom "Apply" button for bulk actions did nothing, and the confirmation dialog before permanent deletion never appeared. Both work now.
* Fixed: Admin — the Help link in the plugin header now opens the WordPress plugin guide instead of the API developer docs.
* Fixed: Admin — the welcome screen no longer leaves an empty item in the WordPress Dashboard submenu.
* Fixed: Admin — the WordPress toolbar no longer overlaps the ActiveLayer logo and Help link on mobile screens.
* Fixed: Ninja Forms — forms without entry storage can be submitted again after a spam rejection without reloading the page. Each retry is checked for spam again.
* Fixed: Tools — Empty Trash, Delete All Spam and deletion of old submissions now immediately refresh cached counts, charts and submission details on sites using a persistent object cache.
* Compatibility: Tested up to WordPress 7.1.

= 1.6.2 =
* Fixed: WPForms — notification emails for forms with Repeater fields now include every row. Previously only the first row appeared in the email, even though the entry itself stored all of them.
* Fixed: Submissions — dates and relative times are now shown in your site's timezone. On sites not set to UTC the times were off by the timezone offset (a submission made at 16:11 in Berlin appeared as 18:11), and a brand-new submission could read as "2 hours ago".

= 1.6.1 =
* Fixed: Multisite — subsites did not create their submissions table, so on those sites the dashboard stayed stuck loading and form submissions were never checked for spam. Each site now creates its table automatically.
* Fixed: Dashboard — the analytics chart no longer spins an endless loading indicator on sites that have no submission data yet (e.g. brand-new installs).

= 1.6.0 =
* Added: WordPress Abilities support (WordPress 6.9+) — registers read-only abilities (list, search, and view submissions; get statistics; get settings) so compatible tools and AI assistants can query your anti-spam data without changing anything.
* Fixed: WPForms — held email notifications are now released correctly when the background queue runs through the admin-ajax async runner.

= 1.5.0 =
* Added: Easy Digital Downloads integration — spam protection for product reviews and the standalone customer registration form. The EDD checkout is never gated, so spam protection can't interrupt a purchase.
* Added: FunnelKit Funnel Builder integration — synchronous spam blocking for opt-in (lead capture) forms before FunnelKit runs its email, CRM contact, and webhook actions, with per-form control.
* Improved: Client-side signal diagnostics — submissions now report whether behavioral and environment signals arrived intact, were empty, or were stripped before reaching the server, helping the API tell real visitors from tampered requests more accurately.

= 1.4.1 =
* Improved: WooCommerce — account registration during checkout now completes smoothly without an inline spam check, keeping the purchase flow uninterrupted. The standalone My Account registration form stays protected.
* Improved: MemberPress — paid memberships complete signup without an inline spam check for a seamless checkout. Free memberships, free trials, and fully-discounted signups remain protected, with an optional setting to extend checks to paid signups.

= 1.4.0 =
* Added: AffiliateWP integration — synchronous protection for affiliate registration before the affiliate and WordPress user are created.
* Added: MemberPress integration — synchronous protection for membership registration before the WordPress user account and membership are created.
* Added: WS Form integration — synchronous spam blocking before WS Form saves entries or runs actions, with per-form protection controls.
* Added: New translations — Italian, Japanese, Dutch, Brazilian Portuguese, and Simplified Chinese.
* Fixed: Message body — links and line breaks in submitted messages are now preserved when sent to the spam API, improving detection accuracy.
* Fixed: WPForms — marking an entry as "Not Spam" in the admin no longer re-runs detection or reverts the entry.
* Fixed: Dashboard — the plugin recommendation now detects and activates an already-installed Pro variant instead of downloading the Lite version.

= 1.3.1 =
* Fixed: Internal plugin version constant was left at 1.2.0 in the 1.3.0 release, so browsers and page caches kept serving outdated CSS/JS assets after the update. Asset cache-busting now works correctly again.

= 1.3.0 =
* Changed: Form protection now enabled by default for all supported providers after API key connection. Existing forms with explicit disable setting remain disabled until re-saved.
* Added: BuddyPress and BuddyBoss integration — anti-spam protection for community signup (registration) forms. Blocked signups are labelled "Member" in the Submissions log.
* Added: One-click Connect — create and link your free account in one step, with the API key saved automatically on return.
* Fixed: PHP 8.4 compatibility — explicitly typed nullable constructor parameters to silence the new implicitly-nullable deprecation notice (behaviour unchanged on PHP 7.2+).

= 1.2.0 =
* Added: WooCommerce integration umbrella — full anti-spam coverage for the two highest-risk WooCommerce surfaces (Product Reviews and Customer Registration), managed from a single panel under ActiveLayer → Integrations.
* Added: WooCommerce Reviews protection — every product review is scored on submission, with optional verified-owner bypass, logged-in-user bypass, and high-confidence auto-delete.
* Added: WooCommerce Registration protection — blocks bot signups on the My Account form, classic `[woocommerce_checkout]`, and the new Cart/Checkout Blocks (default since WooCommerce 8.3). The "Allow customers to create an account during checkout" setting is honoured in every flow.
* Added: Silent-discard option for high-confidence spam comments and WooCommerce reviews — items at or above the configurable score threshold (default 95) are hard-deleted instead of moved to the spam folder. (#127)
* Added: Native moderation feedback for WordPress comments and WooCommerce product reviews — moderator decisions (approve / spam / trash) are sent back to the ActiveLayer API to improve detection accuracy.
* Fixed: Comments — moderator email notifications are now suppressed until ActiveLayer returns a verdict; deferred notification is dispatched correctly when a held comment is restored.
* Fixed: WooCommerce Reviews — moderator notifications are likewise suppressed while a review awaits classification.
* Fixed: Fluent Forms — abort message is now sent as a string to prevent a frontend TypeError when a blocking message is shown.
* Fixed: Submissions — the View Submission screen now surfaces the API error message for failed submissions instead of hiding the API Response panel entirely, making API outages easier to diagnose.
* Fixed: WPForms Pro — duplicate notification emails on failed-submission retries. `EmailReconstructor::allow_submission()` is now idempotent: a persistent marker on the WPForms entry prevents the daily retry sweep from re-releasing already-sent notifications when the API is unavailable. (#154)
* Fixed: Gravity Forms — admin notifications arrived with an empty body and stripped subject merge tags when ActiveLayer protection was enabled.
* Compatibility: Tested up to WordPress 7.0.

= 1.1.0 =
* Added: Gravity Forms integration with per-form control and notification management.
* Added: Elementor Forms integration for Elementor Pro form widgets.
* Added: Fluent Forms integration with per-form spam detection and email handling.
* Added: Forminator integration with per-form toggles and notification replay.
* Added: SureForms integration with per-form control.
* Added: Global Sync Mode setting for inline spam blocking on supported integrations.
* Added: Client-side behavioral analysis (keystrokes, mouse, touch, scroll).
* Added: Environment detection for headless browsers and automated tools.
* Added: Tools page with bulk delete of old submissions and retention controls.
* Added: Sync Save strategy for WPForms (full synchronous save with email replay).
* Added: Conditional frontend script loading — scripts load only on pages with protected forms.
* Added: API Status link in dashboard quick access.
* Added: Client signals output for Fluent Forms.
* Added: UTM tracking parameters on outbound links.
* Added: `activelayer_show_tracking_mode` filter for advanced workflows.

* Improved: Consolidated admin notices via `NoticeHelper`.
* Improved: Security hardening — output escaping, `$wpdb->prepare()` coverage, input sanitization.
* Improved: Deactivation and uninstall cleanup across all integrations and transients.
* Improved: Build pipeline with QA site deployment and asset rebuilds.
* Fixed: Comments integration now requires a valid API key before activating.
* Fixed: Graceful handling of null submissions in async worker.

* Fixed: Ninja Forms SpamCheckAction edge cases.
* Fixed: Elementor Forms edit link uses `page_id` instead of element hash.
* Fixed: Activation redirect slug and hook priority for first-time installs.
